    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Data protection is of great personal concern to me, which is why this website has been designed to comply with the legal requirements (GDPR, Austrian Data Protection Act) and the principles of privacy by design and privacy by default. 

    This website has been developed with open-source technologies by myself and hosted on servers in the EU (Germany and/or Finland).

    There is no tracking or profiling and no advertising is displayed.
